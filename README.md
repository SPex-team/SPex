# SPex is a decentralized storage provider exchange space on FVM

# How it works
* Sellers change the Owner Address to the SPex smart contract and place sell orders
* Buyers request to purchase and send funds to SPex smart contract
* Send payment to Seller after minus the transaction fees
* SPex smart contract transfers the ownership to buyer
